As for the arithmetic in Transformer Inference, details can be found in an article, presented in https://kipp.ly/transformer-inference-arithmetic/. Besides the discussion of FLOPs, analysis was also made on the memory costs. In addition, reference can be made in another artile found presented in the webpage https://www.adamcasson.com/posts/transformer-flops.

In analysis, the Roofline model has always been used, and in https://www.baseten.co/blog/llm-transformer-inference-guide/, there is some analysis work on LLM inference and performance. Based on the roofline model, benchmarking tests were conducted to investigate the inference performance of LLM models, as shown https://www.baseten.co/blog/benchmarking-fast-mistral-7b-inference/.
